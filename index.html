        <h2>Great White Shark</h2>
        <img src="./assets/great-white-shark.jpg">
        <p>These cunning creatures like to take their prey by surprise. They usually position themselves underneath their unsuspecting victims before swimming up andâ€¦chomp! They often burst out of the water in a leap (called a breach) before falling back in with their meal in their mouths.

    <section id="bullshark">
        <h2>Bull Shark</h2>
        <img src="./assets/bull-shark.jpg">
        <p>Bull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, as well as their pugnacious disposition and a tendency to head-butt their prey before attacking. They are medium-size sharks, with thick, stout bodies and long pectoral fins. They are gray on top and white below, and the fins have dark tips, particularly on young bull sharks.

    <section id="tigershark">
        <h2>Tiger Shark</h2>
        <img src="./assets/tiger-shark.jpg">
        <p>These large, blunt-nosed predators have a duly earned reputation as man-eaters. They are second only to great whites in attacking people. But because they have a near completely undiscerning palate, they are not likely to swim away after biting a human, as great whites frequently do.
