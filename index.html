    <h1>Deadly Sharks</h1>
    <p>While there are many types of sharks in the world, below is a list of the top three dangerous sharks based on shark attack reports.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>Great White Shark</li>
        <li>Bull Shark</li>
        <li>Tiger Shark</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Great White Shark</h2>
    <p>These cunning creatures like to take their prey by surprise. They usually position themselves underneath their unsuspecting victims before swimming up andâ€¦chomp! They often burst out of the water in a leap (called a breach) before falling back in with their meal in their mouths.
    </p>

    <h2>Bull Shark</h2>
    <p>Bull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, as well as their pugnacious disposition and a tendency to head-butt their prey before attacking. They are medium-size sharks, with thick, stout bodies and long pectoral fins. They are gray on top and white below, and the fins have dark tips, particularly on young bull sharks.
    </p>

    <h2>Tiger Shark</h2>
    These large, blunt-nosed predators have a duly earned reputation as man-eaters. They are second only to great whites in attacking people. But because they have a near completely undiscerning palate, they are not likely to swim away after biting a human, as great whites frequently do.
