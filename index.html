        <h2>Great White Shark</h2>

        <p>
            Just the name Great White Shark is enough to send people running from the beach. Already notorious the Jaws movies of 1975 further demonised this shark (if that was necessary?!) and consolidated its reputation as a man eater.

            These cunning creatures like to take their prey by surprise. They usually position themselves underneath their unsuspecting victims before swimming up and…chomp! They often burst out of the water in a leap (called a breach) before falling back in with their meal in their mouths.

        <h2>Bull Shark</h2>

        <p>
            The bull shark is a large powerful shark, measuring up to 11.5 feet (3.5m) in length and up to 700lbs (318 kg) in weight. Bull sharks get their name from their short, blunt snout, as well as their pugnacious disposition and a tendency to headbutt their prey before attacking. They are medium-size sharks, with thick, stout bodies and long pectoral fins. They are gray on top and white below, and the fins have dark tips, particularly on young bull sharks.

        <h2>Tiger Shark</h2>

        <p>
                Hear the word tiger and you think vertical stripes, but those stripes evolve over time. Baby tiger sharks—a.k.a. pups—are covered in roundish gray spots that fuse into stripes as the sharks mature. After a certain age, the stripes start to fade; they’re barely visible in full-grown adults.

            These large, blunt-nosed predators have a duly earned reputation as man-eaters. They are second only to great whites in attacking people. But because they have a near completely undiscerning palate, they are not likely to swim away after biting a human, as great whites frequently do.
